# Introduction:

### The Boston dataset, available on Carmen, contains 506 observations across 15 variables: crim, zn, indus, chas, nox, rm, age, dis, rad, tax, ptratio, black, lstat, medv, and Resp. The variable crim measures the per capita crime rate by town, while zn represents the proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 square feet. The variable indus indicates the proportion of non-retail business acres per town, and chas is a binary variable equal to 1 if the town borders the Charles River and 0 otherwise. The variable nox measures nitrogen oxide concentration (per 10 million), and rm represents the average number of rooms per dwelling. The variable age gives the proportion of owner-occupied units built before 1940, while dis is the weighted average of distances to five Boston employment centers. The variable rad indexes accessibility to radial highways, and tax reports the full-value property tax rate per $10,000. The variable ptratio denotes the pupil-teacher ratio by town, and black is calculated as 1000 x (B-0.63)^2, where B is the proportion of Black residents. The variable lstat reflects the percentage of lower-status individuals in the population,and medv represents the median value of owner-occupied homes (in $1,000s). Finally, Resp is an unknown quantitative response variable that we will analyze throughout this project. 

### The goal of this report is to apply the analytical techniques learned in this course to conduct a comprehensive data analysis of the Boston dataset. We will begin with an exploratory analysis to examine each variable individually, followed by an investigation of the relationships between the 14 predictors and the response variable, Resp. After identifying significant predictors, we will perform model selection using a refined dataset that includes only those variables. The data will then be split into training and testing sets, and we will explore multiple modeling approaches to evaluate predictive performance. Finally, we will compare model results and select the most effective model based on accuracy and interpretability.
